🧒👵 Age & demographics: Youngest/oldest employee, employees by age group, gender by age bins, marital status.
💵 Pay view: Ethnicity vs average salary to spot pays patterns.
🧭 Performance tracker: Pick an employee and see job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, work‑life balance, self-rating, and manager rating over time.
⚠️ Attrition diagnostics: Attrition by role, department, overtime, travel frequency, hire year, and tenure buckets.

🔥 High-risk roles: Sales reps (~40% attrition) and some tech roles (data scientists ~24%).
⏳ New hire risk: Most exits happen in the first year (~35% for 0–1 year) — onboarding or role-fit issue.
